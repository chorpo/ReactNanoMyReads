# MyReads

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

It also enables searching books and adding them into your bookshelves.

This project is part of final assessment projects for Udacity's React Nano Degree course.
